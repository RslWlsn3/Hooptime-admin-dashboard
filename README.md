# Hooptime Admin Dashboard
## About
The Hooptime admin dashboard is an application that allows Hooptime admin's to delete players or teams which are deemed inappropriate. By entering a username or team ID, all data that is correlated with that player or team will be removed from the database. If a player is removed from a team where he/she is the team captain, a new team captain is automatically assigned.
